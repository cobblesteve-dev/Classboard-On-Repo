## Welcome to Classboard!
This website originally started on Google Sites, and I'm moving it to a repo.
It's going to allow me to expand this website faster and better

## Features
- Google Services
- Games
- Powerschool
- Newsletter
- Embeds
- Memes
- Videos
- Minecraft
- Downloadables

## It's being constantly updated too!
We try to keep content fresh with weekly updates.

## Future Updates
We're trying to add mobile games like Brawl Stars, Roblox, and more.

## What about the Google Sites version?
If this repo becomes permanent, we might stop updating the Google Sites version. No, it won't be deleted, but it could turn into a link hub or not be updated anymore.

## Need the link to the Sites version?
It's right here! â®• https://sites.google.com/view/class-board
